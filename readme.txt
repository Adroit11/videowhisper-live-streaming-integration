Video Whisper Live Streaming software includes live video broadcast, embeddable live video watch and chat, embeddable live video streaming.  Use this software to add features like on justin tv, ustream tv, mogulus, stickam, blog tv, live yahoo or their clones.  

This plugin uses the WordPress username to login existing users. If the user is not logged into WordPress a warning message is shown and the visitor can click that to get back to the main WordPress website for registration/login. 

Also includes a plugin that provides a linking widget. The widget also displays online broadcasters and their show names.

There is a settings page with multiple parameters and permissions (what users can broadcast and watch).

BuddyPress integration: If BuddyPress is installed this will add a Live Stream tab to the group where users can watch live video and chat realtime. Admins can broadcast anytime from Admin > Live Streaming.
