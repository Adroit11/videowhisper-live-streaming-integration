The VideoWhisper Live Streaming software can easily be used to add video broadcasting to WordPress sites and live video streams on blog pages.

== Description ==

Video Whisper Live Streaming software includes live video broadcast, embeddable live video watch and chat, embeddable live video streaming.  Use this software to add features like on justin tv, ustream tv, mogulus, stickam, blog tv, live yahoo or their clones. The software is built using latest AS3 technology. 
We setup a simple integration that uses the WordPress username to login existing users. If the user is not logged into WordPress a warning message is shown and the visitor can click that to get back to the main WordPress website for registration/login. We also included a plugin that provides a linking widget. You can use that or directly add a link to "http://www.your-site.com/videowhisper_streaming/" .
The widget also displays online broadcasters and their show names.
